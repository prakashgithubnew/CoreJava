**Difference between TDM and PM**
---------------------------------

    TDM 

* Focuses on Technical execution of project

* Manages the technical aspects of the project, such as coding standards, 
  architecture, technical debt, integrations, and deployment.

    
    PM

* Focuses on overall delivery of project

* They ensure that the project is completed within scope and within time, but they are less 
   involved in the technical details.
